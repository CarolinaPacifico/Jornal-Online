                Surely you have already thought of going to one of the many wonders of the world, 
                right? But what about the new one's? The New 7 Wonders of the World was a research 
                campaign that recreated in a totally informal and unscientific, just recreational way, 
                the original 7 Wonders of the World List. This research campaign was conceived by a Swiss 
                organization, called New Open World Corporation (NOWC), and started in the year 2000 and lasted 
                until 2007. At first, the list of selected monuments had 200 members, but, with the research being 
                done through internet voting and short calls (with possibilities for anyone around the world to vote), 
                it was reduced to 77 monuments, because of the public votes. In the end, however, only 20 monuments 
                were finalists, as the Necropolis of Giza in Egypt was removed from this list of finalists to receive 
                its "Honorary Wonder"

                title, leaving those to be decided by criteria of beauty, complexity, historical 
                value, cultural relevance, among others, by a group of professional architects led by Federico Mayor. 

                Announced on July 7, 2007, at Est√°dio da Luz in Portugal, Lisbon, the list of the New Seven Wonders of 
                the World today has as its 7 monuments only those from extinct cultures and one from the Christian religion 
                (Christ the Redeemer).
